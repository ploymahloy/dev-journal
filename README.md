- Rediscovered the sibling selector `+` in CSS. I had been trying to create a nested dropdown menu for my All Access clone project, and noticed the descendant selector `space` was not functioning correctly. Of course, this only works on descendant DOM elements and I had not paid proper attention to the relationship of the elements in my project! I will now add this [link](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understanding-use-of-the-and-symbols-in-css-selectors-95552eb436f5) to my reading, posted here for reference.
