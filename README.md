- Rediscovered the sibling selector `+` in CSS. I had been trying to create a nested dropdown menu for my All Access clone project, and noticed the descendant selector `space` was not functioning correctly. Of course, this only works on descendant DOM elements and I had not paid proper attention to the relationship of the elements in my project! I will now add this [link](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understanding-use-of-the-and-symbols-in-css-selectors-95552eb436f5) to my reading, posted here for reference.

- Taking some time to reflect on yesterday's issue ^, I realize at this point that my time should be spent less in building everything from scratch (dropdwon menus) and more on shipping completed works to show potential employers and clients. Using component libraries can be a crutch and will make debugging issues harder if the base knowledge is not there, but since I was able to solve my problem ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/ploymahloy/pen/GRxEPOp?editors=1100)), I think that I have earned the right to use said components to shorten this aspect of production. I'm going to be using MatierialUI just for the sake of its popularity. AntD is next on my list.
- Learned what it means to fork a repo and why, thanks to this video ---> [Git Fork vs. Git Clone: What's the Difference?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YQxkxw8nhE)

- I cannot get even my codepen ^ to work in my NextJS project. I'm bashing my head against the wall trying to understand how this can work in my project. Days like these I think it best to call it a night.
