- I found an [article](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-add-event-listener-to-body) that may be the final piece of the puzzle. I just need to set up an event listener to detect clicks outside of the dropdown menu. Then, I can use that to trigger a function to close the menu (`display: 'none'`).

- Something I'm realizing is that if I can put into words what I'm trying to accomplish, I can better articulate a Google search. Better yet, if I can articulate what I'm trying to do in my code, the solution has already been posted thousands of times online. An example of this is something that happened today: I wanted to use font awesome icons as the `menu_title` in my dropdown menu component, but couldn't figure out how to do it. For whatever reason, I thought to make a vanilla js switch statement where if the `menu_title` prop value was a string, then it would display the string as the title. Otherwise, the title would display the icon based on key-value pairs (menu_title={1} ----> 1: <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBars} />). This completely bypasses React's functionality and doesn't really make sense as a long-term solution. I even realized what was going on and said "wait, all I'm trying to do is pass the jsx as a prop value...." 10 seconds later I referenced a project that passes jsx as a prop value via curly braces `menu_title={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBars} />}`. Better by the day!
- In its current state, my dropdown menu component displays its submenu on hover. To mimic All Access, I need the dropdown menus to open only `onClick`. I initially attempted to use `state` to set the display property of the submenu from `hidden` to `block`. I ended up finding [this link](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hook-detect-click-outside-component/) which outlines how one developer created a custom hook to detect clicks outside of the component. My mission tomorrow is to absorb this, and apply it to the dropdown menu. The only thing left after that is to connect the routing to all the pages represented in the navbar's menus. I'm actually looking forward to solving this, whereas just a week ago I was agonizing over running into obstacles. The path to project MVP is much clearer now, despite having much more work to do.

- Something I am realizing about myself is that I make things harder than they need to be. Here I am trying to use JUST divs and spans to create a dropdown menu from scratch (see codepen from 7.24, it functions, but only in a vaccuum). I completely ignored that the STANDARD is to use a select tag with nested option tags. Knowing the standard and acknowledging it from the jump would have been more helpful. I need to start assuming that everything I am trying to accomplish at this stage has been done, redone, reformatted, and rebranded. I don't need to create problems, I need to create projects. I need to start my career.
- It works!

- I cannot get even my codepen to work in my NextJS project. I'm bashing my head against the wall trying to understand how this can work in my project. Days like these I think it best to call it a night.
- I coudn't help myself and tried again. I was able to get one option, the dropdown above the navbar, to come close to what I want. Although it's not in the navbar, it's a step in the right direction....I hope.... (Reflection: This is too little progress for a few hours' work. This is not sustainable. I need to be more productive, and THAT is where my frustration lies).

- Taking some time to reflect on yesterday's issue, I realize at this point that my time should be spent less in building everything from scratch (dropdwon menus) and more on shipping completed works to show potential employers and clients. Using component libraries can be a crutch and will make debugging issues harder if the base knowledge is not there, but since I was able to solve my problem ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/ploymahloy/pen/GRxEPOp?editors=1100)), I think that I have earned the right to use said components to shorten this aspect of production. I'm going to be using MatierialUI just for the sake of its popularity. AntD is next on my list.
- Learned what it means to fork a repo and why, thanks to this video ---> [Git Fork vs. Git Clone: What's the Difference?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YQxkxw8nhE)

- Rediscovered the sibling selector `+` in CSS. I had been trying to create a nested dropdown menu for my All Access clone project, and noticed the descendant selector `space` was not functioning correctly. Of course, this only works on descendant DOM elements and I had not paid proper attention to the relationship of the elements in my project! I will now add this [link](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understanding-use-of-the-and-symbols-in-css-selectors-95552eb436f5) to my reading, posted here for reference.
