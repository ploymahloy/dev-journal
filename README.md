# dev-journal
Journal for tracking web dev progress.

- Got somewhere with the personal site. I need to figure out why I get a hydration issue just from wrapping react icons in a div. It's so frustrating because I know nothing about that so now I have to try to understand a relatively advanced topic just to get my icons to work in a grid. I had a rough week so I doubt that will happen today.

8.5.2022
- I can NOT put into words how much I hate my personal site. I redesigned it to include a more subtle variation of the Brutalist buttons I made a few days ago. It bothers me how hard it is for me to design a damn website. I know I just need a good reference, but I can't find one that I like that is also within reach in terms of my skillset. I spent a whole damn week and a half at least just writing a dropdown menu from scratch...

8.3.2022
- I might have my first freelance client! My friend works for a home improvement company and the owner, with whom he is close, has expressed interest in a website. Currently, the business gets their customers via word of mouth, and their Facebook pages seems to come up high on Google searches for services they provide. This could be a HUGE milestone, despite the technical works being as easy as I want it to be with templates being wideley available.

8.2.2022
- I was inspired to do something different and made a nav bar inspired by Brutalism ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/ploymahloy/pen/ZExrMXE?editors=1100)). I think I'll be dedicating all day tomorrow to the sorting algorithm visualizer. It was one of the projects that caught Google's eye for Cl√©ment Mihailescu, supposedly. I like the idea of impressing prospective employers. I like the idea of a coding job.
- Since I had a lazy day with coding, I decided to make another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ploymahloy/pen/YzaedZQ) for kicks. I had been toying with the concept of an inverted color overlay for a few days and wanted to see it come to fruition:

8.1.2022
- I made a list of things to accomplish this week. Since the mortgage app, dictionary app, and cli calculator are all somewhat small in scale, I've decided to add an eCommerce project site (in addition to the All Access clone) to my portfolio. I plan to have the eCommerce site, the homepage of All Access, my personal site (revamped), the dictionary app (revamped), and my resume done by this time next week. Time to execute!
- Stumbling through NextJS, I'm enjoying the process so much more because I have more knowledge to support me while debugging, for example. I had a hell of a time just staying awake at work so my lack of focus on code after work has not been surprising. Tomorrow is an earlier day for me so I'll make up the difference then. There's no sense in overdoing it...but I did end up starting on the All Access clone homepage anyway...less to do tomorrow!

7.31.2022
- I looked at the portfolio/projects of one of my cohorts from my bootcamp that got a dev job after graduation. The portfolio page had 'noob' written all over it, and the projects were not anything special. It inspired me to remove ChartJS from the mortgage calculator app, and added an svg pattern background with an inset box shadow to bring focus to the app itself. I'm going to do something similar to the dictionary app as it doesn't look incredibley appealing either. Once I get that done, I'm going to redeploy (chaged homepage urls) the two projects, rework my personal site as it's not super greatm and then start applying to jobs finally. I'm so close, and I can't wait to start my dev career.<br> Before && After:<br>

- I redeployed THREE sites in about 15 minutes, and I feel great about that. I struggle with git sometimes because all I want is a `Command + Z` for whatever caused my good, but being able to navigate gh-pages well enough to redploy three sites in short order aligns with my desire to become more effective with my time. I have experienced efficiency in spending a good portion of my time learning logic and debugging, but now I feel as though I can apply these lessons to produce action faster, or at least as fast as expected in a developer on a production team. Next step is to revamp my personal site!


7.30.2022
- A week after I started logging my progress, I was able to create solve a problem I'm not sure could have been solved without the reflection that a journal provides. I tried learning Redux from some YouTube videos but I kept getting red errors despite following their instructions exactly. I think I'm going to give an article on Redux a try.
- Tying up some loose ends I've been sitting on a mortgage caclulator site for a while. Ive got the logic functioning properly, but it looks ridiculous. Fortunately, I spent the past week dealing with CSS properties in React so I should at least be able to make a site look right.

7.29.2022
- I found an [article](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-add-event-listener-to-body) that may be the final piece of the puzzle. I just need to set up an event listener to detect clicks outside of the dropdown menu. Then, I can use that to trigger a function to close the menu (`display: 'none'`).
- Correction: The above article only attached an `eventListener` to the document `body`. I still need to figure out how to conditionally trigger an event based on the component that was click. Something like `if (e.target !== this.whatever) {setIsActive(false)}`. Still a work in progress.
- [This article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hook-detect-click-outside-component/) on creating a custom hook to detect a click outside of the component is the one that I was looking at last night. If I can't apply the logic to my project for whatever reason, despite being very close, I'm just going to use headlessUI's [Menu (Dropwdown)](https://headlessui.com/react/menu). At this point I'm feeling satisfied in knowing that I have a definite solution available via headlessUI, but will be even more rewarded by creating the functionality from scratch. I'm frustrated by how long this has taken me and how many hours have been wasted even though it hasn't been a true 'waste,' rather a sub-optimal progression. 
I know that this is one of the hardest aspects of the project. I'll need to make modals (check), routing (check), and that's most of the project. It's unfortunate that I had to tackle this difficult part first, but I'm getting a better underestand of the useEffect Hook, and React logic in general. Another takeaway from this week will be the useOutsideClick Hook; which I plan to dissect and save for future use.
- I did it! Built the dropdown menu component all from scratch. I'm very satisfied with being able to do this without relying on a UI library. Speaking of libraries and frameworks, I got rid of the TailwindCSS in this project and am using SASS instead (hence the color change to the exact match of the original app). It makes things easier in my opinion as I seem to enjoy doing everything myself.

7.27.2022
- Something I'm realizing is that if I can put into words what I'm trying to accomplish, I can better articulate a Google search. Better yet, if I can articulate what I'm trying to do in my code, the solution has already been posted thousands of times online. An example of this is something that happened today: I wanted to use font awesome icons as the `menu_title` in my dropdown menu component, but couldn't figure out how to do it. For whatever reason, I thought to make a vanilla js switch statement where if the `menu_title` prop value was a string, then it would display the string as the title. Otherwise, the title would display the icon based on key-value pairs (menu_title={1} ----> 1: <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBars} />). This completely bypasses React's functionality and doesn't really make sense as a long-term solution. I even realized what was going on and said "wait, all I'm trying to do is pass the jsx as a prop value...." 10 seconds later I referenced a project that passes jsx as a prop value via curly braces `menu_title={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBars} />}`. Better by the day!
- In its current state, my dropdown menu component displays its submenu on hover. To mimic All Access, I need the dropdown menus to open only `onClick`. I initially attempted to use `state` to set the display property of the submenu from `hidden` to `block`. I ended up finding [this link](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hook-detect-click-outside-component/) which outlines how one developer created a custom hook to detect clicks outside of the component. My mission tomorrow is to absorb this, and apply it to the dropdown menu. The only thing left after that is to connect the routing to all the pages represented in the navbar's menus. I'm actually looking forward to solving this, whereas just a week ago I was agonizing over running into obstacles. The path to project MVP is much clearer now, despite having much more work to do.

7.26.2022 
- Something I am realizing about myself is that I make things harder than they need to be. Here I am trying to use JUST divs and spans to create a dropdown menu from scratch (see codepen from 7.24, it functions, but only in a vaccuum). I completely ignored that the STANDARD is to use a select tag with nested option tags. Knowing the standard and acknowledging it from the jump would have been more helpful. I need to start assuming that everything I am trying to accomplish at this stage has been done, redone, reformatted, and rebranded. I don't need to create problems, I need to create projects. I need to start my career.
- It works!

7.25.2022
- I cannot get even my codepen to work in my NextJS project. I'm bashing my head against the wall trying to understand how this can work in my project. Days like these I think it best to call it a night.
- I coudn't help myself and tried again. I was able to get one option, the dropdown above the navbar, to come close to what I want. Although it's not in the navbar, it's a step in the right direction....I hope.... (Reflection: This is too little progress for a few hours' work. This is not sustainable. I need to be more productive, and THAT is where my frustration lies).

7.24.2022
- Taking some time to reflect on yesterday's issue, I realize at this point that my time should be spent less in building everything from scratch (dropdwon menus) and more on shipping completed works to show potential employers and clients. Using component libraries can be a crutch and will make debugging issues harder if the base knowledge is not there, but since I was able to solve my problem ([CodePen](https://codepen.io/ploymahloy/pen/GRxEPOp?editors=1100)), I think that I have earned the right to use said components to shorten this aspect of production. I'm going to be using MatierialUI just for the sake of its popularity. AntD is next on my list.
- Learned what it means to fork a repo and why, thanks to this video ---> [Git Fork vs. Git Clone: What's the Difference?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YQxkxw8nhE)

7.23.2022
- Rediscovered the sibling selector `+` in CSS. I had been trying to create a nested dropdown menu for my All Access clone project, and noticed the descendant selector `space` was not functioning correctly. Of course, this only works on descendant DOM elements and I had not paid proper attention to the relationship of the elements in my project! I will now add this [link](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understanding-use-of-the-and-symbols-in-css-selectors-95552eb436f5) to my reading, posted here for reference.
